Hey there!

Basically, I respect your right to privacy. Therefore I will endeavour to reduce the amount of data my site, and by extension I, collects about you wherever I can. However, you should know that I use Google Analytics to collect anonymised data about the pages you visit and how long you stay on the site. I can also see some data about you, including your approximate location based on your public IP address as well as the browser and operating system you're using. You can read Google's full privacy policy [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Of course, you can turn off Google Analytics cookies at any time by using the icon in the bottom left corner.

On the subject of managing cookies, I use a service called [Osano](https://osano.com) to allow you to disable anylitics, personalisation, and marketing cookies. The essential cookies on the site are for storing your cookie preferenses (I know, cookies to store info about cookies) and to allow the parkrun cancellation map to work.

If you ever have any questions, you can email me at [hello@josh.me.uk](mailto:hello@josh.me.uk?subject=Privacy Policy) and I'll do my best to reply promptly.
