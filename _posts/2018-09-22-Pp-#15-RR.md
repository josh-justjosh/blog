164 runners, joggers and walkers braved the threat of rain for the 15th parkrun in Pocket park. 12 first-timers joined us this weekend as well as 29 tourists including [Tim Mosedale](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=473444) who completed his 50th different parkrun with us this weekend and [Andis Ozols](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=186082) who completed his 177th different parkrun! Another person joined the 50 parkruns club: [Callum Nicholson](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=147084) who finished 2nd with a new Pocket PB. 53 other runners achieved PBs this weeked with the weather just holding off and the trails quite dry.

The First Finisher this week was [Steven Baldwin](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1695724) in a new PB just shy of 18 minutes (just 2 second away!) and the First Female Finisher was [Vicky Hanania](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4678408), also with a new PB shaving 14 **minutes** off her previous time (you read that right).

Of course, we must acknowledge our 32 volunteers who made this weekend’s run possible: Michael Ball, Becki Barnett, Steven Barnett, Natalie Bartlett, Izzy Bunting, Emily Bunting-Cleary, Joanne Carrington, Mark Crane, Elizabeth Dalrymple, Joel Benjamin Davison, Christopher Ferguson, Mateusz Grzegorczyk, James Holmes, Caroline Holmes, Gill Joynes, Kenny Leckie, Di Leckie, Steve Moore, Jacob Radley, Lee Radley, Finley Roberts, Sonny Roberts, Cate Saunderson, Holly Simpson, Charlotte Simpson, Harriett Simpson, Laura Steed, Kerry Surkitt, Sarah Tully, Sharon Williamson, Chris Windebank, Simon Winter and this week’s Run Director, Stephen Ferguson.
