This week 182 runners, joggers and walkers turned out for PocketÂ parkrun number 16 and of those, there were 17 people for whom this weekend was their first parkrun. [Tracy Crowley](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=575426), [Clare Slater](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=781295), and [Jaimee Barker](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1387096) joined the 50 parkruns club. Tracy finished 40th in a PB of 23:43, Claire finished 89th in a PB 26:57 and Jaimee finished 163rd in 39:20.

[Lynne Regan](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4654842) remains the only person to take part in every Pocket parkrun and overall our events we've run a combined total of over 16,000km! Another runner who ran a PB this weekend was [Steve Deacon](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=121879) who was in Pocket park for the first event and since then has run at three-quarters of the runs (12 in total) and since his 3rd parkrun he has got a new PB every week - that's nine PBs in a row! Over the weeks, he's managed to shave 7 minutes off his first time back in June.

83 runners ran new PBs this weekend in times ranging from 19:51 all the way to 48:45 but whatever the time: a PB is still a PB! Another mention should go to [William Shippin](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=54594) who finished 3rd in 19:44 at parkrun and then made the short trip to Sandy where he ran in the 5K at the Biggleswade AC Open and finished 2nd in an even faster time of 17:16

Now, on to the First Finishers. Here we run into an issue: the male first finisher didn't get their barcode scanned! So the first person to finish and get their barcode scanned was [Adam Harris](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4490264) in a time of 19:34 and this week's female First Finisher was [Chloe Haffenden](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=69859) in 21:19 who was one of our first timers in Pocket park.

If you'd like to help out next week (or any other week) you can have a look at the [future roster](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/volunteer/futureroster/) or email [pockethelpers@parkrun.com](mailto:pockethelpers@parkrun.com) and ask what you can do.

During the week, a new [Strava Club](https://www.strava.com/clubs/PocketParkrun) was created for the Pocket parkrun. If you're a Strava user you can join by clicking [here](https://www.strava.com/clubs/PocketParkrun). Where you can compare your activities outside (and inside) of Pocket park. By the way... if you've been wondering what those orange logos are on the side of the results page: you can click on them and it'll take you to that runner's profile on Strava. In the event that you have a Strava account but don't have to logo next to your name, you can link your Strava profile and parkrun profile by clicking [here](https://www.parkrun.com/profile/) and pressing 'Connect with Strava'.
