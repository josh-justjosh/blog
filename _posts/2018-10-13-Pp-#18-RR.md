This Saturday, 199 parkrunners braved the winds of storm Callum to take part in the 18th parkrun in Pocket park. Of course as well as the wind there was the rain! I thought that we'd just got away with it but no - it really chucked it down at about the 40 minute mark. 62 parkrunners were first timers to Pocket (31% of the field) and 8 of those ran in their inaugural parkrun with us this weekend. Of those runners joining is for their first time, [Steve Grout](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1788159) ran at his 50th different event dressed in a cow onesie. We also had 17 tourists from [Eye Community Runners](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/clubhistory?clubNum=1576) join us in Pocket park.

Both of our first finishers were first timers in Pocket this weekend, [Paul Keating](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=986400) was finished in a time of 18:58 and [Hannah Mcinroy Naylor](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=200636) finished 17th overall in a time of 21:29. 47 people achieved new PBs this weekend including 11 under 18s! [Tyler Parker](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4748810) was one of those under 18s, he ran a time of 21:09 and is trying to gain sponsorship for[his Camp Equador Adventure](https://www.facebook.com/CampEquador/?__tn__=K-R&eid=ARCdr_35tQiokDFEUUZgWo2LskgicWD7GiMYL867TxmGzxuRQuNIDkrgby05HTjXzZM3u0Y0xSxQX9ou&fref=mentions&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDm1D8ANxpaWbO7Kw_4G2dFEhiPOVI3_ESFLXyEGFJ06ohON1by8s04URnxbMoD0o6AfPIMqMWOStKeZQLcrD7TGCMNHegDgcOhQxAhMzXy0wRIOyqsaWi8AbXB6cPMzf72Afl88wKpiieDXWKV85nJ1ZuYj7w0r2z-58Yllg9SfUa-bDOwHg) in 2020. [Tim Butterworth](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=627973) had the highest age grade once again this week with 78.20% and a time of 19:39.
