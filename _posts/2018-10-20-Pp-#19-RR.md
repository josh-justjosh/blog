This Saturday saw 173 people gather in Pocket park for the 19th parkrun. This week I wasn’t one of them but that doesn’t mean that I can’t bring you some analysis of the results this weekend. 30% of everyone walking, jogging or running finished with a new PB this week and 39 people completed Pocket parkrun for the first time, 17 of them participating in their first ever parkrun. [Chris Butterworth](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=287219) was our first finisher this week running in a time of 18:13. He’s part of an illustrious list of 11 pocketeers who have finished first at every Pocket parkrun they’ve taken part in but becomes the first person to have run at multiple events and was the first finisher in both of them. This week’s female first finisher was a Junior by the name of [Olivia Mead](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1173541) who ran a 20:59 at her first parkrun here in Pocket park. As well as being the first female finisher, she finished 2nd on the age-graded standings with a fantastic 73.87%. [Tim Butterworth](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=627973) came top of the age grade rankings for the third week in a row. He achieved 80.31% and a new PB of 19:08. Today, our 1,600th different parkrunner in Pocket park crossed the finish line. [Zoe Timbrell](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=5062158) who finished in a time of 39:27 has that honour. It’s not always the fast ones that get the glory!
