Welcome to the run report for the 22nd parkrun in Pocket park. 165 runners, joggers and walkers joined us on a nice sunny morning. The route was a bit slippy this week thanks to rain we had on Friday night but that didn't stop 40 people achieving a new PB! Of those 7 people have achieved back-to-back PBs both last week and this week. [Mick Odell](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4526718) however, is the only one of those seven to gain a PB for three weeks in a row! Of the 165 parkrunners this weekend, 34 of them took park in their first Pocket parkrun and 15 joined us for their first ever parkrun.

This week’s first finisher was [James Shiner](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=2596562) who finished in a time of 18:12 and our female first finisher was [Amelia Fleming](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=3014582) with 22:01. [Tim Butterworth](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=627973) once again was the person with the highest age grade with 79.41% and a time of 19:21
