Rather than starting with the running stats this week, I’m going to change things up a bit and first say thank you to our 22 volunteers who helped out at Pocket parkrun this weekend: Barry Robinson, Becki Barnett, Caroline Henderson, [Caroline Holmes](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=415657), [Christopher Ferguson](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=311483), [Christopher Skepper](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=3655506), Elizabeth Dalrymple, James Holmes, [Julia Page](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=508834), [Kathy Unwin](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1642948), [Kenny Leckie](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4073128), Kirstie Buck, [Kirsty Rapley](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=3452167), [Mark Crane](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4072444), Norma Leckie, [Sarah Tully](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4909207), [Stephen Ferguson](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=190582), [Steve Moore](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1771782), [Steven Barnett](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4179392) and this week’s run directors, [Charlotte Simpson](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=2079756) and [Joanne Carrington](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=181580).

There are 33 Charlotte Simpsons registered in the parkrun system, but only our very own [Charlotte Simpson](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=2079756) has now volunteered at 25 parkruns! If you were wondering why there were some people running in very fetching purple t-shirts: they’re also members of the Volunteer 25 club - so now you know. I’d like to use this opportunity to apologise to [Steve Moore](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1771782), our resident results processor, who joined the Volunteer 25 club a few weeks ago but I neglected to mention him in the report. Congratulations to both of you!

As well as our volunteers, 167 people ran, jogged or walked the course this week. Of them, 35 joined us for the first time and 48 recorded new PBs. First finisher this week was [Callum Nicholson](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=147084) in a new PB of 18:35 and female first finisher was [Rhiannon Jordan](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=5165753), a first timer coming in at 22:14. The person with the highest age grade this week was [Cameron Dunsmore](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1822055) who recorded 76.42% in a new PB of 19:18. [Jordan Page](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4731460) was the only other person to reach a milestone this weekend running his 10th parkrun in a new PB of 20:24
