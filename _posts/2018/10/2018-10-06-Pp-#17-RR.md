The drizzle and wind held off (mostly) on parkrun's 14th birthday as 154 people gathered at the start of the 17th parkrun in Pocket Park. 35 people took part in this week's event for the first time including 13 who ran their very first parkrun. 28 Juniors also joined us of whom 9 got PBs. Of the 123 adult runners, 33 achieved a new Pocket PB and [Steve Moore](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1771782), [Andrew Johnson-Chapman](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1343572) and [Barnaby Donohew](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4705204) all ran back-to-back PBs (both this week and last). [Lynne Regan](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4654842) continued her streak of Pocket parkruns with a new PB of 29:21.

The first finisher this week was first timer [Chris Butterworth](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=287219) in a time of 18:03 and our female first finisher [Sophie Darling](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=59391), another first timer, in 22:10. Sophie ran with her fianc√©e [Thomas George](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1859826) following their engagement at [Whistler parkrun](http://www.parkrun.ca/whistler/) in Canada! I think it's also important to recognize the parkrunners with the highest age grade each week. Today, [Tim Butterworth](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=627973) had the highest age grade with 78.80% and finished 2nd overall in a time of 19:30. So Son and Father finished 1st and 2nd this weekend.

Over 1,500 people have now run at Pocket parkrun since the event started back in June (1507 to be exact) and 305 people ran their first ever parkrun in Pocket park which is just over one in five.
