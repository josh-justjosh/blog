170 people turned out in freezing conditions on Saturday morning for the 20th Pocket parkrun. 41 people ran their first Pocket parkrun this weekend and 12 of them ran their first ever parkrun with us this weekend. 53 people ran new PBs including 5 Junior runners! [John Smith](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=3088785) was on of 1,144 people globally to run their 50th parkrun this weekend.

Everyone who came top of their various leaderboards this week were first timers. The first finisher was [Christopher Wright](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=429954) who ran a time of 17:37 and our female first finisher, [Kate Hughes](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=783747), finished 19th overall in a time of 22:09. This week the person with the highest age grade was [David Wright](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=455714) who achieved 77.46% and finished 12th in a time of 20:42.

Thanks to everyone who came out to support Pocket parkrun this weekend, whether you ran, walked, jogged, cheered or volunteered. If you’d like to volunteer next week (or any week) you can go to [www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/volunteer/](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/volunteer/) to find out more or email [pockethelpers@parkrun.com](mailto:pockethelpers@parkrun.com) to see what you can do.

My apologies for a very stat heavy run report this week but half term stuff has meant I couldn’t join you all in Pocket park. I will hopefully be with you next week to run my 10th parkrun!

Until next week,

DFYBC - (Only 4 of you did this weekend!)
