The first Saturday of November saw 169 runners, joggers and walkers descend on Pocket park for the first parkrun on the winter course. I personally thought the course felt quicker and this was shown when the results were published with 59 people achieving new PBs this weekend, of those - 5 were junior runners. The first finisher of the 21st parkrun in Pocket was [Chris Butterworth](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=287219) in a time of 18:11 keeping his 100% win ratio and [Ieva Klavina](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=2814416) was this week’s female first finisher in 22:43 finishing 22nd overall. The person who finished with the highest age grade was [Piers Serjeant](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=607178) who achieved 74.82% and finished 5th in a PB of 18:48.
