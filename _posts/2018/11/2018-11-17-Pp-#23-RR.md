157 runners, joggers and walkers joined us on Saturday morning for the 23rd Pocket parkrun. The sun kept threatening to emerge from behind the clouds but it remained obscured for the duration of the event. Joining us this morning were a variety of superheros, from Spider-man to Batman to Superman. I think I also saw the Joker running in memory of Stan Lee, who passed away on Monday. Congratulations to all of them, I don’t know how you managed in your various costumes! Also joining us were 11 people running their first ever parkrun and 8 people who were running in Pocket park for the first time. Of the 135 who had come along before, 64 (just shy of half)  managed a new PB, of whom 12 were junior runners. On to the first finishers. Male first finisher was [Chris Butterworth](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=287219) finishing in a new PB of 17:43 and female first finisher was [Olivia Hooper](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4031479) who also achieved a new PB in a time of 21:11. The runner with the highest age grade this week was [Faith Taylor](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1240026), an under 10 who managed an astonishing 75.24% and a PB of 22:41, putting all us older runners to shame...
