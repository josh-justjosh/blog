118 walkers, joggers and runners joined us on a rather chilly parkrunDay for the 26th parkrun in Pocket park. 18 people pushed through the cold (and wind) to set new PBs and 20 people joined us for the first time - including 3 for their first ever parkrun.

First finisher this week was [Chris Bingham](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=4990184) who came in at 19:10 and female first finisher was [Natalie Jane Morgan](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=54524) who ran a 21:36 on her first time in Pocket park. [Tim Butterworth](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=627973) had the highest age grade once again this week - a 78.53% - and a time of 19:34.
