On the last parkrun before Christmas, a group of Santas (and a few Elves) descended on Pocket park for the 28th Pocket parkrun. There were lots of great photos that were taken by our marshals and they've all been added to an album on Facebook which you can find [here](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1108425302660799&type=1&l=5bb1eecf5d).

142 runners, walkers and joggers took part and 13 ran new PBs despite the slippy paths. I really think we were on the edge this week but I didn't see anyone with a muddy bum so I'd assume everyone made it round safely!

First finisher this weekend was [Simon Mead](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=158937) in a new PB of 17:44, he was also the person with the highest age-graded score with 80.55%. First female finisher was [Hayley Read](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=4680863) in another new PB of 20:37.
