A massive thank you to all 40 of you. Our volunteer team was made up from the combined forces of [Cambridge](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/cambridge/), [Coldham’s Common](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/coldhamscommon/), [Huntingdon](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/huntingdon), [Jubilee junior](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/jubilee-juniors/) and of course, our own amazing Pocketeers.

Of the 519 finishers, nearly 100 ran a #parkrundouble. If you didn't know, New Year's Day is the only day in the year that parkrunners can have two results registered in the results system. Most of the doublers who did half of thier 2019 parkruns so far in Pocket park did thier other half in [Huntingdon](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/huntingdon) - 78 in fact. The others came from [Great Denham](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/greatdenham/) and [Letchworth](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/letchworth/)! A number of [Hunts AC](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/clubhistory/?clubNum=1763) runners also ran the 20km between Huntingdon & Pocket parkruns as well as the 5k at either end!
