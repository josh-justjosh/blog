This is just a post that I'll keep updated with any interesting statistics I find. If this is your sort of thing, there is a [parkrun stats geeks](https://www.facebook.com/groups/parkrunstatsgeeks/) group that you might find interesting and it's one of the places I've found my info.

Of the 519 people parkrunning in Pocket:

*   48.9% did a double (254)
*   50.7% were first timers in Pocket park (263)
*   11.0% ran a new PB (57)
*   4.2% ran thiervery first parkrun! (22) -  8.3% of all first timers this week
*   just 3.8% forgot thier barcode (20)

of those 254 parkrun doublers:

*   90.9% also ran in Huntigdon (231)
*   6.3% also ran in Great Denham (16)
*   2.8% also ran in Letchworth (7)

231 makes Huntingdon -> Pocket the 26th most popular double worldwide an the 20th most popular in the UK

Around the world:

*   There were 153 'solo doublers' that were the only people to complete those two parkruns.
*   The most popular double was Linford Wood -> Milton Keynes (490)
*   There were 38,176 people who ran doubles
*   People ran 626,875km on New Years Day at parkruns (not includng the extra distance by those who also ran between events)
*   That's the same as travelling around the world 15.6 times!
*   or running to the moon and halfway back!
*   60.9% of kilometers run were run by those doing a double
