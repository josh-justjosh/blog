To all our new Pocketeers that have joined us over the last few parkruns: welcome, I hope you have enjoyed your first parkruns here in Pocket park and will keep coming back!

One last thing, please can everyone gather on the field somewhere between the finish and the volunteer's table, rather than at the start or on the path. This is to ensure that everyone can here any saftey announcements in the run director's briefing and so we're not blocking other park user's acces to the paths for any longer than we need to. Thanks

Untill next weekend,

DFYBC (7 of you did this week)
