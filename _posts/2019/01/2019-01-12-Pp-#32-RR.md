269 people ran, walked and jogged in slightly miserable conditions on Saturday morning. That's a new record of participants at a 'normal' parkrun (ie. on a Saturday) in Pocket park continuing our growth this year. We had 66 first timers and 26 people took part in parkrun for the first time ever! Of the 203 people who had run Pocket parkrun before, 90 ran a new PB.

Both male and female first finishers this week were fist timers in Pocket park: [Ian Hammett](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=388290) ran a 17:47 and [Helen Rhodes](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=227048) ran a 23:29.

I'd like to thank [Amanda Brown](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=368598) for being a 30 minute pacer this week. While I didn't quite keep up right all the way to the end, it was really helpful to have a flag bobbing up and down in the distance to try and stay in sight of!
