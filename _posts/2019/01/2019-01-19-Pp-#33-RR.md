Pocket park saw 217 people run, walk and jog this week's parkrun. As is the case at this time of year, the ground was a bit slippy under foot so the Core Team does recommend you get yourself some trail shoes to help you grip the mud. Also, as it's "the end of the season" (even though it's still January) there could be some great deals if you go looking.

Of of the 217, 38 people joined us for the first time and 56 people achieved new PBs. 20 out of the 38 newbies ran thier first parkrun this weekend, a special congratulations to them.

[Chris Butterworth](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=287219) was this weeks first finisher in a time of 18:12 and first timer [Bethan Everson](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=2241243) was the female first finisher in a time of 19:19. The person with the highest age grade was [Ann Storey](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=3408341) with 80.01% and a New PB of 28:46.
