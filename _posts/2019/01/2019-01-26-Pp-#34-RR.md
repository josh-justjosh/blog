For the first time in what feels like for ever, it wasn't bitterly cold as 202 parkrunners came to Pocket park for this week's parkrun. Among them, 32 first timers (17 of whom were first time parkrunners) and 45 new PBs.

This weekend was the last in January and as such, was the last parkrun people could do as part of RED January. This campain by Mind, the mental health charity, has been a community initiative that encourages you to support your mental health by doing something active every single day. In 2018, the RED community raised over £1 million for the Mind charity.
