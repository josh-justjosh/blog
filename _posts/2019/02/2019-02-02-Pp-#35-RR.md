This week, 180 parkrunners braved freezing temperatures at the 35th Pocket parkrun. The official advice from Run Director [Antony Moore](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=2865977) was to take it easy as the gound was very hard and slippy in places. Despite this, 34 people still managed to set new PBs and the only incident was when the Start/Finish pop up sign slightly exploded in Antony's face during set up! We also had 33 people joining us for the first time and 10 running their inaugural parkrun. Thank you to everyone who used the school playground or the Conygear carpark  to park this morning, it worked really well and hopefully we'll be able to do the same for the next few weeks. First finisher this week was [![250_club_mini](https://images.parkrun.com/blogs.dir/1667/files/2019/02/250_club_mini.jpg)](http://www.parkrun.com/about/parkrunclubs)[![25_club_mini](https://images.parkrun.com/blogs.dir/1667/files/2019/02/25_club_mini.jpg)](https://images.parkrun.com/blogs.dir/1667/files/2019/02/25_club_mini.jpg)[Lloyd Cross](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=208558) in atime of 18:16 and female first finisher was [Natalie Jane Morgan](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=54524) in a time of 22:13.
