Today, 237 ran, walked and jogged round Pocket parkrun. We had an unusually large group of first timers this morning - 42 in fact, 22 of whom were running a parkrun for the first time. Among those who had run Pocket pefore, there were 52 PBs today. We also had a number of tourists with us from Kings Lynn, Milton Keynes, St Albans and Cambridge. Perhaps the loudest tourist we've ever had, [Sharon Threlfall](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=1214897)[![100_club_mini](https://images.parkrun.com/blogs.dir/1667/files/2019/02/100_club_mini-e1550337018730.jpg)](https://images.parkrun.com/blogs.dir/1667/files/2019/02/100_club_mini-e1550337018730.jpg)[![25_club_mini](https://images.parkrun.com/blogs.dir/1667/files/2019/02/25_club_mini-e1550337100687.jpg)](https://images.parkrun.com/blogs.dir/1667/files/2019/02/25_club_mini-e1550337100687.jpg), an RD at Westmill parkrun, celebrated an arbitry 150th parkrun with us this weekend. #BlameStephen This week, our first two finishers forgot thier barcodes!
