This weekend saw Pocket parkrun's first takeover event. Girlguiding took over events all over the UK as part of their world thinking day. Another reason they were here in Pocket park was to ask if anybody would be willing to volunteer at Rainbows, Brownies or Guides. If you'd like to you can register to volunteer by [clicking here](https://go.girlguiding.org.uk/join-us/join-as-volunteer/ "Girlguiding - Join as a Volunteer") or you can find out more by [clicking here.](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/get-involved/become-a-volunteer/ "Girlguiding - Become a Volunteer")

Today there were 226 parkrunners taking part on what was, I think you'll agree, was a morning I was hoping would be a bit brighter. Nethertheless, there were 48 people at Pocket parkrun for the first time including 25 who were taking part in a parkrun for the first time. 65 people acheived new PBs this weekend.

First finisher this week was [Benvenuto Baldelli](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=57695) in a time of 17:43, female first finisher was [Amelia Fleming](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=3014582)[![50_club_mini](https://images.parkrun.com/blogs.dir/1667/files/2019/02/50_club_mini-e1550336989477.jpg)](https://images.parkrun.com/blogs.dir/1667/files/2019/02/50_club_mini-e1550336989477.jpg) in a new PB of 21:30.
