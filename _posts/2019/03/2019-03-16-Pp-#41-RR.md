This weekend's parkrun was certainly a windy one. 162 runners, joggers and walkers avoided getting blown over and 24 people joined us for the first time including [John Robert Richardson](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=90274)[![250_club_mini](https://images.parkrun.com/blogs.dir/1667/files/2019/02/250_club_mini-e1550337068377.jpg)](https://images.parkrun.com/blogs.dir/1667/files/2019/02/250_club_mini-e1550337068377.jpg)[![25_club_mini](https://images.parkrun.com/blogs.dir/1667/files/2019/02/25_club_mini-e1550337100687.jpg)](https://images.parkrun.com/blogs.dir/1667/files/2019/02/25_club_mini-e1550337100687.jpg) of [Swaffham parkrun](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/swaffham/) in Norfolk. He had a 7am departure this morning to join us this weekend as he completed his third county of parkruns. As of today he's run all the parkruns in Norflok, Suffolk & now Cambridgeshire. Congratulations!

Next weekend will be the first of two takeover pacer weeks in the coming months. Nice-Tri will be pacing next Saturday (23rd March) and Riverside Runners will be pacing on 13th April. From Saturday 6th April we will also be back running on the summer course - hopefully the weather becomes more summer-esque between now and then!
