Firstly I'd like to congratulate all of the 103 people who achieved new PBs this weekend. Well done to you all! This week's parkrun was brought to you with help from the St Neots NiceTri Triathlon Club who provided us with pacers and marshals. Thank you to all those who helped out. [Sally Jex](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=1938829) was one of them and she took hundreds of photos at today's parkrun. If you'd like to see them, check out the [Pocket parkrun facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/pg/pocketparkrun/photos/?tab=albums)

Another group of parkrunners that deserve a mention are the couch to 5k graduates who ran today's event. Congradulations to all of you and we hope to see you all back next week.
