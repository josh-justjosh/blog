In Ireland this week there were three sets of elections:

*   European Elections for 13 MEPs (2 of whom will not take their seats until the UK leaves the EU) in 3 regions: Dublin (4), South (5) & Midlands-North-West (4). There are of course also EU elections in NI where 3 MEPs are elected.
*   Elections to all 31 local Councils.
*   A national referendum on relaxing divorce restrictions.

With counting for the EU elections only starting this morning at 8am IST, results are not expected until later this afternoon.
