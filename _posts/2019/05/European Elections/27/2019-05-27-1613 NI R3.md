In stage 3 Diane Dodds of the DUP became the first MEP of NI elected, She had an excess of 12,310 votes. They'll be transferred at a percentage of 7.9% to their next preferences. That means that, the number of votes that could be transferred will be multiplied by 7.9% to get the total votes transferred to be 12,310 - rather than 155,422.
