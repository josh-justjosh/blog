Stage 4 results have just been announced, no one gained enough votes from Diane Dodds' surplus of 12,310. 83.8% of those votes went to Jim Allister (TUV). Of the candidates remaining, Colum Eastwood has the lowest number of votes so will be eliminated. 82,413.5 votes will now be transferred at their "full value". This means that they will keep the value that they currently have - rather than having their values reduced as Diane Dodds' surplus were.
