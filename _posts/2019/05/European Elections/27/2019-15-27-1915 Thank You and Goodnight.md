The last 24 hours have brought us a number of firsts.

The first time the Conservatives have done this badly since the 19th Century and the first time Northern Ireland is represented by 3 female MEPs.

It's also the first time I've done this whole blogging thing properly. I hope you have enjoyed my coverage of the UK's EU parliamentary elections and I will see you next time there's a national election (maybe October?)
