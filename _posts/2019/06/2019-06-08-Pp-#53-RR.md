Well that was horrible! Well done to all 193 people who made it round a very slippy and rainy Pocket park on Saturday. To the 11 of you who took park in their first parkrun: it's normally a lot nicer in June.

A special thanks to all the volunteers and pacers from NiceTri. It's lovely to have the support of the local sports groups here in St Neots and I hope the rain hasn't put you off doing another takover soon.

The first finsiher this week was [Tom Stead](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=55360) in a new PB of 18:34 and our first female finisher was [Ellie Sherriffs](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=5047401) in a time of 21:38. The highest age grade went to [Maurice Hemingway](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=73075) with 75.13% and a new PB of 22:07.

A massive thank you to all our volunteers to brave the rain this week: [Alison Wright, Charlie Watkins,](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=4847891) [Charlotte Simpson,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=2079756) [Chris Wright,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=102088) [Christopher Ferguson,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=311483) [Colm Crowley,](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/athleteresultshistory?athleteNumber=251185) [Elizabeth Cowell,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=5095759) [Elizabeth Studd,](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=5216917) [Helen Saxton,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=831489) [Ian Payne,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=4899316) [Jeremy Hill,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=705026) [Joanne Carrington,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=181580) [Joanne Kirkham,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=4936439) [Josh Brunning,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=4196740) [Katie Ridley,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=157484) [Keith Ritchie,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=296603) [Kerry Surkitt,](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=693485) [Lucy Boothby,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=80287) [Mandy Rodgers,](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=3771302) [Michaela Ridley,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=157480) [Natalie Bartlett,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=1795380) [Nikki Wright,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=4524361) [Paul Newell,](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/athleteresultshistory?athleteNumber=227249) [Pedro Cabrita,](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=4678750) [Phil Whitbread,](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/athleteresultshistory?athleteNumber=944146) [Richard Rodgers,](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=5364212) [Ryan Moroney,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=4446050) [Sarah Tully,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=4909207) [Simon Boothby,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=80288) [Steve Childerley,](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=547131) [Steve Moore,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=1771782) [Sylvane Anderson-Brown,](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=5606624) [Tina Codling,](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=472826) [Tracy Crowley](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=575426) and our Run Director [Stephen Ferguson](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=190582)[.](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=575426)
