This weekend was our one year anniversary of parkrunning here in Pocket park. Before we have a look at this parkrunDay's results here are some of the stats from our first year:

Over our first 53 events there have been 70 different first finishers and 3,036 different participants completing 10,638 parkruns. People have acheived 2,568 PBs and have run a total of 53,190km in 233 days, 3hrs, 37mins & 26secs. The average number of finishers per event was 200 over the year with the average time being 0:30:12. The highest attendance we had was 519 parkrunners on New Years Day.

On our winter course, the fastest male time was [Nathan Harrison](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/eventhistory/athletehistory?athleteNumber=190690)'s 15:49 in April with the fastest female time being [Bethan Everson](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/eventhistory/athletehistory?athleteNumber=2241243)'s 19:19 in January. For the summer course, the fastet male time was [David Hudson](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/eventhistory/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1271677)'s 16:17 in September and the fastest female time was [Jo Oregan](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/eventhistory/athletehistory?athleteNumber=2780544)'s 18:39 at our inaugural event back in June 2018.

Back to this weekend, there were 251 parkrunners, 32 PBs, 47 first timers and 11 people parkrunning for the first time. This week's first finisher must have forgotten their barcode so the first recorded finisher was first timer [Tom Keighley](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=1607946) with a time of 18:08. The female first finisher was [Sarah Burrell](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=293249) in a time of 20:19. The person with the highest age grade was [Mike Bull](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=111861) with 77.11% and a time of 23:09.
