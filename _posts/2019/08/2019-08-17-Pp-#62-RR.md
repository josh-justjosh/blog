After last weekend's high winds causing over 70 cancellations in across the UK, today was a much nicer affair with the sun shining! As a result, 202 people took part in Pocket parkrun this morning with 29 people volunteering. 46 people joined us for the first time and 30 people recorded new personal bests this weekend.

[Neil Shorten](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/firstfinishescount/athletehistory?athleteNumber=114717) finished first for the first time here this weekend with a time of 17:51 and also achieved the highest age grade with 77.03%. [Hayley Bond](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=4680863) was the first female finisher with a time of 21:15.

Thanks to all of this week's volunteers!

Over the summer it will be more difficult to get volunteers as our usual crowd may be off on holiday. So if you're planning on coming along to cheer someone on: you could volunteer as a marshal! You still get to cheer and you get a warm feeling inside knowing you've helped out.
