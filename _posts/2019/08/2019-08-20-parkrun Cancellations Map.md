Over the last few months, I've been producing a map showing the cancellations of parkruns for the upcomming weekend. parkrun HQ recently has overhauled the parkrun website and the events map. Doing this has changed the source of the locations of parkruns around the world.

Before the changes, there was a geo.xml file that showed just the 5k 'senior' parkruns. Now there is an events.json file that helpfully now shows junior parkruns as well as senior ones. Yesterday I spent some time changing the spreadsheet I made to help make these maps and my parkrun cancellations map can now show junior events.

The map is also now available to view at [josh.me.uk/parkrun-cancellations](/parkrun-cancellations) and will hopefully be updated each Friday evening ahead of the weekends parkruns. It is also available below!
