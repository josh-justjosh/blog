This weekend was our first weekend back on the winter course. While slightly slippy, I think most people made it round before it started raining properly. This week 145 people ran, jogged and walked the course, of whom 13 were first timers and 26 recorded new PBs.

The first finisher was [Chris BUTTERWORTH](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=287219) in a time of 18:27, [Rhian BAILEY](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=3752515) was the female first finisher in 22:51 [Chris CAHILL](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/latestresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=96737) had the highest age grade with 74% and a time of 19:56.
