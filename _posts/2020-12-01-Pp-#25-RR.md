A windy, rainy and slippy Pocket park greeted our 142 parkrunners and 27 volunteers this Saturday. Of those 142 runners, walkers and joggers, 22 were first timers here in Pocket parkrun and 28 managed PBs despite the harsh conditions. Special shoutout to [Nikki McSeveney](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=5173525), [Roxan Alexander](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=5090838), [Sam Mahoney](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=5090502) who perhaps could have chosen a better morning to run their first parkruns!

First finisher this week was [Gary Evans](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=289364) who finished in 17:57 - 1 second off a PB! And female first finisher was first timer [Sarah Burrell](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=293249) who came in at 20:10. [Tim Butterworth](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/pocket/results/weeklyresults/athletehistory?athleteNumber=627973) achieved the highest age grade with 80.52% and a time of 19:05.
