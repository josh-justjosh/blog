The website seems to have reappeared after it fell over earlier today. Currently, the source of the problem seemed to be [fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) a content delivery network used by GitHub pages. All seems to be okay but I will continue to monitor the situation - you can follow any other updates [on twitter](https://twitter.com/_Josh_justJosh). [githubstatus.com](https://www.githubstatus.com/) seems to be saying all is good.
