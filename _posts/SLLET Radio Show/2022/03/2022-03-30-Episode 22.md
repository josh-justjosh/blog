In their last show before Varsity, they're quite tired but Josh and Dan still manage to do two hours of live radio (even if both of them had to leave the studio for bits of it). Josh will be back on 27th April and Dan will be back on 4th May. Don't forget - 18th May they'll be live from the Sports Centre for Basecamp to Summit with the Climbing Club raising money for Climers against Cancer.
