Thank you to everyone who has listened to the any of the last 50 shows. It has been such a journey from breaking the system every week, to only breaking the system every other week! But in all seriousness, thanks to everyone who has come on any of the shows, and thank you especially to Dan for being my co-host for 30 of those 50.

Remember to follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/slletshow">@SLLETshow</a> to find out when the next show will be! (Don't worry, I don't even know when that will be)
